                    <p>not all should know but they do as far as knowledge is concern it reduces the happiness of one which poseeses it that is one main disadvantages of knowledge it might be useful and dangerous if you decide to take not full but half of the existed knowledge and deciding to follow or work with the wrong knowledge </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>During these year too much intake of knowledge have caused a lot of problems which by now you may have noticed <br /> it  might be very hard for by the time you are reading this is what i have been thinking but the course of nature have change and as there is no fate i might not be  100% predictible about you since everything have changed and i am only sure you might be more advanced than how you have always been <br /> i once said you might lost everything by the time you are reading this but i know deep dowm i was always wrong you are not bound to lose anything that is important to you and if anything like that happens it was not important just let go as there are many other important things that you can not risk losing nothing was never your fault whether knowingly or unknowlingly and there is nothing as an end or disaster when it comes to you I USED TO BELIEVE IN SOMETHING GOOD AS WE HAVE ALWAYS BELIVETH <br />They might think some of the things you do is total rubbish and extreme nusiance in a way that you might feel like a bozo but nevermind as you deal with what comes after not what comes before as all can be compared with what is currently in progress. <br /> you know as you have every details of every memeories, feelings and experience i have and knows the value of important things </p>
                    <br />
                    <p>i want to send things to either one of these which i can not easily deciphered and i don't know of i am suppose to send it to realm of mystery or the knowledge realm. i know for sure the realm of knowledge cannot be overriden it cannot be change it can only be increased while the mystery realm is yet to be in perfection </p>
                    <br/>
                    
                    <p>I have to decide regardless of the situation and it is confirmed if i decide to choose the realm of knowledge then all the shape course of the mystery realm is bound to change forever will i be ready to take that risk? if i however decide to embark on with chossimg the realm of knowledge i will be lost since my knowledge will increase drastically and to which i have no access to im the present gifted time and concerning that it may just be a superiority of enternity which cannot be experienced or accessed. </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>It is infact in high standard rate of choosing the mystery realm since it might be the best choice amd at sometimes may seem to be weak which is not entirely the limit as far as it is concern it is proved it is just the initialization of some callaborated supremacy which is access amd experienced both externally and internally </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I am highly required to emerge to a choosen choice which i need to enlight <br /> To decide on what is going to be the right choice let every bit of planning be in a free will don not get entangle with some extreme human emotions which is rather powerfull but renders you weak be vigilant, wise and smart when making every step </p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>I RATHER BE WEAK AND GIVEN IMMENSE SUPREMACY FOR ETERNITY IN THE REALM OF MYSTERY THAN EXPERIENCING NOTHING IN THE REALM OF BLISSFUL KNOWLEDGE WITH NO ACCESS TO UNTIMELY AND UNSIGHTFUL GIFTED PEESENT TIME</p>
                    
                    <p>let us think like an enlightened beings as every small action leads to great reaction in return just like the "butterfly effect" 
                    <br /><br /> YOU HAVE A GREAT CHITTA WITH ALL THE CEREBRAL CAPACITORS WE HAVE WE HAVE ABSOLUTE CONTROL OF THE COSMOS <br />
                      <br />
                    THE FUTUTE IS NOT SET THERE IS NO FATE EXCEPT THE ONE WE DECIDE TO CREATE FOR OURSELF </p>
